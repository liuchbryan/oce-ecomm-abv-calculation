# Measuring e-Commerce Metric Changes in Online Experiments

Codebase for the above titled paper, to appear in TheWebConf (ne√© WWW) 2023.

**Abstract**: Digital technology organizations routinely use online experiments (e.g. A/B tests) to guide their product and business decisions. In e-commerce, we often measure changes to transaction- or item-based business metrics such as Average Basket Value (ABV), Average Basket Size (ABS), and Average Selling Price (ASP); yet it remains a common pitfall to ignore the dependency between the value/size of transactions/items during experiment design and analysis. We present empirical evidence on such dependency, its impact on measurement uncertainty, and practical implications on A/B test outcomes if left unmitigated. By making the evidence available, we hope to drive awareness of the pitfall among experimenters in e-commerce and hence encourage the adoption of established mitigation approaches. We also share lessons learned when incorporating selected mitigation approaches into our experimentation analysis platform currently in production.

## Setup
This file assumes you have access to a \*nix-like machine (both MacOS or
Linux would do). If you have a Windows machine, the notebook should still work
provided you have the right Python packages installed, but it is not tested.

This project uses `pyenv` and `poetry` for package management.
Before you start, please ensure you have `gcc`, `make`, and `pip` installed.

### Installing `pyenv`

For Linux (together with other required libraries):

``` bash
sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git
wget -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash

chmod u+x pyenv-installer
./pyenv-installer
```

For OS X:
```
brew install pyenv
brew install pyenv-virtualenv
```

We then need to configure the PATHs:
```
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

...and install the right Python version for our environment:
```
pyenv install 3.9.10
```

### Installing `poetry`
See https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation for the installation instructions.

### Download the repository and sync the environment
```
git clone https://github.com/liuchbryan/oce-ecomm-abv-calculation.git
cd oce-ecomm-abv-calculation  

# Switch to Python 3.9.10 for pyenv
pyenv local 3.9.10
poetry env use ~/.pyenv/versions/3.9.10/bin/python
poetry install
```

### Run the Jupyter notebooks  
```
poetry shell
```

Within the newly spawn up virtualenv shell, run
```
jupyter notebook
```

Once you are done, terminate the Jupyter server using Ctrl+C, and type `exit` to exit the virtualenv shell.


## Notebooks

This repo contain several notebooks that run the experiments, organise the results, and generate the tables and figures featured in the paper.

Experiments:
* `E01 - Vanilla and One-way Bootstrap.ipynb` runs experiments that calculates the vanilla sample standard error (SE) and their re-estimates using one-way bootstrap.
* `E02 - Two-way Bootstrap.ipynb` runs experiments that re-estimates the SE for the average selling price (ASP) metric using two-way bootstrap.

Figures:
* `F01 - Response vs Next Response.ipynb` plots Figure 1 of the paper + the same data in other graph representations / a different scale.
* `F02-03 - Vanilla vs Oneway Bootstrap SE.ipynb` plots Figures 2 and 3 of the paper. It also shows different way to plot the same set of data comparing the vanilla sample SEs to one-way bootstrap estimates.
* `F04 - Actual Power and CI Coverage.ipynb` plots Figures 4 of the paper.

Tables:
* `T01 - Dataset Summary.ipynb` generates the summary of the two public datasets used in the paper, which is included in Table 1 of the paper.
* `T02 - One-way Two-way Bootstrap Comparison (ASP).ipynb` extracts the experiment data that goes in Table 2 of the paper.
